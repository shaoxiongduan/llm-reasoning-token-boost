          "response": "To determine the weight of a large pizza, let's denote the weight of a large pizza by \\( P \\) pounds and the weight of a cup of orange slices by \\( O \\) pounds. We are given that \\( O = \\frac{1}{4} \\) pound.\n\nThe problem states that the weight of \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of a large pizza together with \\(3 \\frac{1}{2}\\) cups of orange slices is the same as the weight of \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of a large pizza together with \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) cup of orange slices. We can express this relationship with the following equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}P + 3 \\frac{1}{2}O = \\frac{3}{4}P + \\frac{1}{2}O\n\\]\n\nFirst, convert the mixed number \\( 3 \\frac{1}{2} \\) to an improper fraction:\n\n\\[\n3 \\frac{1}{2} = 3 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( O = \\frac{1}{4} \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}P + \\frac{7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}P + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the terms involving \\( O \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}P + \\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}P + \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the fractions, find a common denominator for all terms, which is 24. Multiply every term by 24:\n\n\\[\n24 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}P + 24 \\cdot \\frac{7}{8} = 24 \\cdot \\frac{3}{4}P + 24 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n\\[\n8P + 21 = 18P + 3\n\\]\n\nRearrange the equation to isolate \\( P \\):\n\n\\[\n21 - 3 = 18P - 8P\n\\]\n\n\\[\n18 = 10P\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( P \\):\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{18}{10} = \\frac{9}{5}\n\\]\n\nThe weight of a large pizza is \\(\\frac{9}{5}\\) pounds. To find \\( m - n \\) where \\( P = \\frac{m}{n} \\) and \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime, we have \\( m = 9 \\) and \\( n = 5 \\). Therefore:\n\n\\[\nm - n = 9 - 5 = 4\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",

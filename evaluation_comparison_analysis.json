What is the units digits of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row?\nStep-by-Step Answer:",
          "response": "To find the units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row of the given triangular array, we need to analyze the pattern in the units digits of the sum of the numbers in each row. Let's denote the sum of the numbers in the \\(n\\)-th row by \\(S_n\\). We are interested in the units digit of \\(S_n\\).\n\nFirst, let's compute the sum of the numbers in the first few rows and observe the units digits:\n\n1. The first row is \\(1\\). So, \\(S_1 = 1\\).\n2. The second row is \\(1, 1\\). So, \\(S_2 = 1 + 1 = 2\\).\n3. The third row is \\(1, 3, 1\\). So, \\(S_3 = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5\\).\n4. The fourth row is \\(1, 5, 5, 1\\). So, \\(S_4 = 1 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 12\\).\n5. The fifth row is \\(1, 7, 11, 7, 1\\). So, \\(S_5 = 1 + 7 + 11 + 7 + 1 = 27\\).\n\nNow, let's look at the units digits of these sums:\n- \\(S_1 = 1\\)\n- \\(S_2 = 2\\)\n- \\(S_3 = 5\\)\n- \\(S_4 = 12\\) (units digit is 2)\n- \\(S_5 = 27\\) (units digit is 7)\n\nNext, we need to find a pattern in the units digits of the sums. Let's compute the sums for the next few rows and observe the units digits:\n\n6. The sixth row is \\(1, 9, 15, 15, 9, 1\\). So, \\(S_6 = 1 + 9 + 15 + 15 + 9 + 1 = 50\\). The units digit is 0.\n7.

This is because the units digits of the numbers in the 6th row and onwards are all even (9, 9, 9, 9), and their sum will always be even, but the units digit of the sum will be 0 because the sum of any number of even numbers will end in 0.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of the sum of the numbers in the 2023rd row is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",

On how many of these intervals is $P(x)$ positive?\nStep-by-Step Answer:",
          "response": "To determine the number of intervals on which the polynomial \\(P(x) = (x-1)^1 (x-2)^2 (x-3)^3 \\cdots (x-10)^{10}\\) is positive, we need to analyze the behavior of \\(P(x)\\) around its roots. The roots of \\(P(x)\\) are \\(1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10\\), each with multiplicity equal to its position in the sequence.\n\nThe polynomial \\(P(x)\\) is a product of linear factors, each raised to a power that corresponds to its root's position. This means that \\(P(x)\\) changes sign at each root, but the behavior around each root depends on the parity of the multiplicity of the root. If the multiplicity is odd, the polynomial changes sign, and if the multiplicity is even, the polynomial maintains its sign (but does not change it).\n\nIn this polynomial, the multiplicities of the roots are 1, 2, 3, ..., 10, respectively. Therefore, the roots 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 are of odd multiplicity, and thus \\(P(x)\\) changes sign at these roots. The roots 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 are of even multiplicity, so \\(P(x)\\) maintains its sign (but does not change it) around these roots.\n\nWe can break the real number line into the following intervals: \\((-\\infty, 1)\\), \\((1, 2)\\), \\((2, 3)\\), \\((3, 4)\\), \\((4, 5)\\), \\((5, 6)\\), \\((6, 7)\\), \\((7, 8)\\), \\((8, 9)\\), \\((9, 10)\\), and \\((10, \\infty)\\).\n\nSince the polynomial is of degree 55 (the sum of the multiplicities from 1 to 10), and the leading coefficient is positive (because the product of the leading coefficients of each factor \\((x-k)^k\\) is positive), the polynomial will be positive on the intervals where it starts from a positive value, and negative on the intervals where it starts from a negative value.\n\nGiven that the polynomial is continuous and changes sign at the odd-shaped roots, we can determine the sign of the polynomial in each interval by considering the behavior around the roots. Specifically, because the polynomial is positive for large positive or negative values of \\(x\\) and because the sign changes at the odd-shaped roots, the polynomial will be positive on the intervals \\((-\\infty, 1)\\), \\((2, 3)\\), \\((4, 5)\\), \\((6, 7)\\), \\((8, 9)\\), and \\((10, \\infty)\\).\n\nThus, there are 6 intervals on which the polynomial \\(P(x)\\) is positive.

          "response": "To solve the problem, we start by understanding the structure of a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices, 30 edges, and 20 triangular faces. The distance \\(d(A, B)\\) between two vertices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is the minimum number of edges one must traverse to connect them.\n\nIn a regular icosahedron, the possible values for the distance \\(d(A, B)\\) are 1, 2, 3, and 4. A distance of 1 means that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are adjacent vertices (initially, all vertices are adjacent to 5 other vertices). A distance of 2 means that there is a vertex adjacent to both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) but not directly between them, and so on.\n\nTo find the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\), we need to analyze the possible values of \\(d(Q, R)\\) and \\(d(R, S)\\) and the number of ways these distances can be arranged relative to each other. The key insight is that the probability of \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is the same as the probability of \\(d(Q, R) < d(R, S)\\) because the icosahedron's symmetry means that each pair of distances is equally likely to be greater or less than each other. Therefore, the only knocked out case is when \\(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)\\).\n\nThe total number of pairs \\((Q, R)\\) and \\((R, S)\\) is the number of ways to choose 3 vertices from 12, but because the directions are different, we consider all \\(12 \\times 11\\) ordered pairs of distinct vertices. However, the exact number of these is not needed because we only care about the relative order of the distances.\n\nSince \\(d(Q, R)\\) and \\(d(R, S)\\) are equally likely to be greater, less, or equal, and since the icosahedron is regular, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is exactly the same as the probability that \\(d(Q, R) < d(R, S)\\). Therefore, the probability is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) because the third case (where \\(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)\\)) is very rare and does not affect the symmetry.\n\nThus, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), and the sum of the relatively prime integers in the form of \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\) is \\(1 + 2 = 3\\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",

          "response": "To solve the problem of determining the probability that Janet's running total will equal 3 at some point when rolling a standard 6-sided die four times, we will analyze the sequences of outcomes that can lead to a running total of 3. We will consider the possible sequences of die rolls and their corresponding running totals.\n\nFirst, we need to understand that a running total of 3 can only be achieved by rolling the sequence of numbers that sum to 3. The possible sequences are:\n1. roll a 3 on the first roll.\n2. roll a 1 and then a 2, or a 2 and then a 1.\n\nWe will now consider all possible sequences of four rolls and identify which sequences lead to a running total of 3 at some point. \n\nLet's list the sequences that do not contain the numbers so that the running total can never be 3. We will consider the first roll separately because itseto determine immediately if the total can be 3 after any combination of the next three rolls.\n- If the first roll is 1, the remaining sequence is 3- recognized from sequences (1,2) or (2,1).\n- If the first roll is 2, the remaining sequence is 3- recognized from sequences (1,2) or (2,1).\n- If the first roll is 3, the total is 3 on the first roll.\n\nSo, the valid sequences are:\n1. 3 Not possible since we consider four rolls only.\n2. (1, 2) or (2, 1). This gives two sequences: 1- any sequence that ends in 2 or 1; e.g. 1-3, 1-1-2, 1-2-1.\n3. consider all combinations but reducing to re-ope祭祀. e.g. 1- ( involve combination of 3 but with過程 re']))\n4. consider other possible but reduced轨迹 (1,1,1,1-1).\n\nNow we will calculate the probability. To do so, consider the total number of possible outcomes for four rolls of a die. Each roll has 6 possible outcomes, so there are \\(6^4 = 1296\\) possible sequences of four rolls.\n\nNext, we count the sequences where the running total reaches 3:\n- The only explicit possible sequence leading to 3 is 3- so there is only 1 such case represented there are more possibilities but纯 of the track reducing to afford.\n\nThus, the probability that the running total equals 3 at some point in the four rolls is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6^4} = \\frac{1}{1296}\n%.\n\nThus, the probability is \\(\\frac{1}{1296}\\). Given that 1 and 1296 are relatively prime, they are already in their simplest form. Thus, \\(m = 1\\) and \\(n = 1296\\).\n\n\\[\nm + n = 1 + 1296 = 1297\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{1297}\\).",

We have \\( 2023 = 7 \\times 289 \\). Now, we check if 289 is a prime number. Since \\( 289 = 17^2 \\), it is not prime.\n\nThus, 2023 is \\( 7 \\times 17^2 \\), so it has a squared prime factor, and therefore \\( \\mu(2023) = 0 \\).\n\nWe can verify our hypothesis for other values as well, but the pattern holds.

Since there are no restrictions on how many times an element can appear in the sequence, each element can independently be in any of the subsets from the “empty” set to the set that contains all 10 elements. Thus, each of the 10 elements has \\( n+1 \\) choices (it can be in 0, 1, 2, ..., or n subsets).\n\nFor a sequence of length \\( n \\), each of the 10 elements has \\( n+1 \\) choices independently. Therefore, the total number of such sequences is \\((n+1)^{10}\\).\n\nWe need to find the remainder when \\( K = (n+1)^{10} \\) is divided by 10. Note that \\( K \\) does not depend on \\( n \\), but only on the value of \\( n+1 \\) modulo 10. Since \\( n \\) can be any positive integer from 1 to 10, \\( n+1 \\) can be any integer from 2 to 11. We need to consider the last digit (i.e., the value modulo 10) of these values. The last digits of the numbers from 2 to 11 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, and 1, respectively. Raising each of these to the 10th power and finding the last digit, we see that the last digits of \\( 2^{10} \\), \\( 3^{10} \\), \\( 4^{10} \\), \\( 5^{10} \\), \\( 6^{10} \\), \\( 7^{10} \\), \\( 8^{10} \\), \\( 9^{10} \\), \\( 0^{10} \\), and \\( 1^{10} \\) are 4, 9, 6, 5, 6, 1, 6, 1, 0, and 1, respectively.\n\nSince \\( n+1 \\) can be any of these values, the last digit (i.e., the remainder when \\( (n+1)^{10} \\) is divided by 10) will be one of these values. Such values are symmetric and repeat every 10 numbers so for any \\( n \\leq 10 \\), the sum \\( (n+1)^{10} \\) will yield a last digit 1 because all such sequences are consistent with \\( n \\) map directly through to 1, so \\(K mod 10 = 1\\), therefore the final answer of sequence \\(K mod 10\\) is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).",

Write the answer as a simplified fraction $\\frac{m}{n}$, find $m+n$\nStep-by-Step Answer:",
          "response": "To determine the probability that Flora the frog will eventually land at 10 on the number line, we start by recognizing that in each jump, Flora moves a positive integer distance \\(m\\) with probability \\(\\frac{1}{2^m}\\). We need to consider all possible combinations of jumps that sum to 10.\n\nFirst, let's consider the generating function for the probabilities of the jumps. The generating function for the probability distribution is given by:\n\\[ G(x) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^m}{2^m} = \\frac{x}{2-x} \\]\n\nThe probability that Flora will eventually land at position \\(n\\) is the coefficient of \\(x^n\\) in the expansion of \\(G(x)\\). However, since the frog can jump any positive integer number of steps, we dropped the restriction to a fixed number of jumps. We need to consider the probability that Flora can reach 10 in any combination of jumps.\n\nThe probability that Flora will eventually land at 10 is the sum of the probabilities of all sequences of jumps that sum to 10. This is equivalent to finding the coefficient of \\(x^{10}\\) in the expansion of the infinite product \\(\\left( \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^m}{2^m} \\right) \\left( \\sum_{m=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^m}{2^m} \\right) \\cdots\\), but a simpler approach is to consider the infinite series representation of the probability of reaching 10 directly.\n\nThe probability that Flora lands on 10 can be derived by considering the probability of all possible paths that sum to 10. For each number \\(k\\) that can be the final jump (where \\(k\\) is a positive integer and \\(k \\leq 10\\)), the number of steps taken is \\(10 - k\\), and the probability of those steps sums up to 10 in exactly \\(10-k\\) steps. The total probability is thus:\n\\[ \\sum_{k=1}^{10} \\frac{1}{2^k} \\cdot P(10-k) \\]\nbut this simplifies to just the first term because we are looking at all possible combinations of steps that sum to 10, and each step is independent. Thus, the probability is calculated by considering the series:\n\n\\[ P(10) = \\sum_{k=1}^{10} \\left( \\sum_{m_1=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^{m_1}} \\cdot \\sum_{m_2=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^{m_2}} \\cdots \\sum_{m_{10-k}=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^{m_{10-k}}} \\right) \\]\n\nThis is the same as finding the coefficient of \\(x^{10}\\) in the expansion of \\( \\left( \\frac{x}{2-x} \\right)^{10} \\). However, a simpler approach is to consider that each path that sums to 10 is equally likely, and thus the probability is the sum of the probabilities of all possible paths.\n\nThe probability that Flora will eventually land at 10 is thus \\(\\frac{1}{2^{10}} = \\frac{1}{1024}\\). Therefore, the probability is \\(\\frac{1}{1024}\\), and the value of \\(m+n\\) is:\n\\[ m+n = 1+1024 = 1025 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1025} \\]",

The legs of the trapezoid are each of length 1.\n\nFirst, we need to find the height of the trapezoid. If we draw the height from each end of the shorter base to the longer base, these heights will form right triangles with hypotenuse 1 (the length of the legs) and the projection of the height along the longer base. The projection of each height along the longer base is \\(\\frac{2a - a}{2} = \\frac{a}{2}\\). Therefore, we have a right triangle with hypotenuse 1 and leg \\(\\frac{a}{2}\\).

Thus, its center is at \\((0,10)\\). The equation of this circle is:\n\\[\nx^2 + (y-10)^2 = 100\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the points of intersection of these two circles. To do this, we solve these equations simultaneously. Start by expanding both equations:\n\\[\n(x-4)^2 + y^2 = 16 \\implies x^2 - 8x + 16 + y^2 = 16 \\implies x^2 + y^2 - 8x = 0 \\implies x^2 + y^2 = 8x\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 + (y-10)^2 = 100 \\implies x^2 + y^2 - 20y + 100 = 100 \\implies x^2 + y^2 = 20y\n\\]\nSince both equations are equal to \\(x^2 + y^2\\), we can set them equal to each other:\n\\[\n8x = 20y \\implies y = \\frac{2}{5}x\n\\]\n\nNow substitute \\(y = \\frac{2}{5}x\\) back into one of the expanded circle equations.

          "response": "To determine the number of digits in the base-ten representation of the number \\(8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5\\), we first need to simplify the expression and then use properties of logarithms to find its magnitude.\n\n1. **Simplify the expression:**\n   \\[\n   8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5\n   \\]\n   We can rewrite each term using their prime factorizations:\n   \\[\n   8 = 2^3 \\quad \\text{so} \\quad 8^5 = (2^3)^5 = 2^{15}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   15 = 3 \\cdot 5 \\quad \\text{so} \\quad 15^5 = (3 \\cdot 5)^5 = 3^5 \\cdot 5^5\n   \\]\n   Substituting these into the original expression, we get:\n   \\[\n   8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5 = 2^{15} \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^5 = 2^{15} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^{15} = (2^{15} \\cdot 5^{15}) \\cdot 3^5 = (2 \\cdot 5)^{15} \\cdot 3^5 = 10^{15} \\cdot 3^5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\(3^5\\):**\n   \\[\n   3^5 = 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 = 243\n   \\]\n   So the expression becomes:\n   \\[\n   10^{15} \\cdot 243\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of digits:**\n   The number of digits \\(d\\) of a number \\(N\\) can be found using the formula \\(d = \\lfloor \\log_{10} N \\rfloor + 1\\). Here, \\(N = 10^{15} \\cdot 243\\).

Using a calculator, we find:\n   \\[\n   \\log_{10} 243 \\approx 2.386\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\log_{10} (10^{15} \\cdot 243) \\approx 15 + 2.386 = 17.386\n   \\]\n   The number of digits is:\n   \\[\n   d = \\lfloor 17.386 \\rfloor + 1 = 17 + 1 = 18\n   \\]\n\nSo, the number of digits in the base-ten representation of \\(8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5\\) is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

In any one jump, independent of previous jumps, Flora leaps a positive integer distance $m$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2^m}$.\nWhat is the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10? Write the answer as a simplified fraction $\\frac{m}{n}$, find $m+n$\nStep-by-Step Answer:",
          "response": "To determine the probability that Flora the frog will eventually land at 10 on the number line, we start by recognizing that in each jump, Flora moves a positive integer distance \\(m\\) with probability \\(\\frac{1}{2^m}\\). We need to find the probability that the sum of a series of these distances adds up to 10.\n\nFirst, let's denote the probability of reaching position \\(n\\) as \\(P(n)\\). We know that \\(P(0) = 1\\) because Flora starts at 0. The probability of reaching 10 can be expressed as the sum of the probabilities of all possible sequences of jumps that add up to 10.\n\nIf Flora is at position \\(n\\), the next position she can be at is \\(n + m\\) where \\(m\\) is a positive integer. The probability of moving to \\(n + m\\) from \\(n\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2^m}\\). Therefore, the probability of reaching 10 can be written as:\n\n\\[\nP(10) = \\sum_{m=1}^{10} P(m-1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^m} + \\sum_{m=1}^{9} P(m-2) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^m} + \\cdots + P(0) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^{10}}\n\\]\n\nHowever, a simpler approach is to recognize that the probability of reaching any position \\(n\\) is the sum of the probabilities of all possible sequences of jumps that add up to \\(n\\). Since the jumps are independent and the probability of each jump is known, we can use the fact that the total probability of eventually reaching any position is the sum of the probabilities of all possible sequences of jumps that add up to that position.\n\nThe probability of reaching 10 is the sum of the probabilities of all possible sequences of jumps that add up to 10. This is a geometric series with the first term \\(\\frac{1}{2^{10}}\\) and common ratio \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\nP(10) = \\frac{1}{2^{10}} + \\frac{1}{2^9} \\cdot 8 + \\frac{1}{2^8} \\cdot 6 + \\cdots + 1\n\\]\n\nThis is a harmonic series, and the sum of the probabilities of all possible sequences of jumps that add up to 10 is:\n\n\\[\nP(10) = \\frac{1}{2^{10}} + \\frac{1}{2^9} \\cdot 8 + \\frac{1}{2^8} \\cdot 6 + \\cdots + 1 = 1 - \\frac{1}{2^{10}} = \\frac{1023}{1024}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10 is \\(\\frac{1023}{1024}\\). The values of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are 1023 and 1024, respectively, and their sum is:\n\n\\[\nm + n = 1023 + 1024 = 2047\n\\]\n\nThe answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2047}\n\\]",
